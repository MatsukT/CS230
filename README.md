The Gaming Room

**Client and Software Requirements**
The client, The Gaming Room, wanted to expand their existing game, Draw It or Lose It, beyond its current Android-only platform. 
Their goal was to make the game accessible on multiple platforms through a cross-platform solution. 
The requirements included ensuring unique game and team names, limiting the system to only one game instance in memory at a time, 
supporting multiple players per team, and allowing both single- and multi-team gameplay. In addition, the client requested assistance 
with environment setup and streamlining the development process.

**Software Design Goals**
The design needed to be based on the existing Android application while adapting it to a scalable, cross-platform architecture. 
Key considerations included efficiency, performance, and meeting the client’s expectations for usability and functionality.

**Strengths in Documentation**
My instructor noted that I exceeded expectations in the evaluations section, 
where I provided detailed and thoughtful analysis. This part of the documentation highlighted my ability to go beyond surface-level requirements and address deeper considerations for implementation.

**Value of the Design Document**
The structured format of the design document was especially helpful to me. I often have a tendency to overdocument, but the template provided clarity and ensured I focused on essential requirements
without adding unnecessary complexity. This organization kept the project streamlined and prevented me from overwhelming both myself and the reader with excessive details.

**Areas for Improvement**
If I were to revise one area, I would incorporate pseudocode into the documentation. Although I once struggled with it, I’ve grown to recognize its value in larger projects. 
Including pseudocode would provide the team with a clearer understanding of how requirements translate into logic, while also helping identify which team members possess the right skillsets 
for implementation.

**Interpreting User Needs**
I excel at understanding and translating user needs into technical requirements, and this project was no exception.
In software design, the role of consultant or contractor often resembles that of a translator—bridging the gap between client expectations and developer implementation. 
This step is critical: failure to accurately capture client needs can result in wasted effort, dissatisfied stakeholders, and products that miss the mark.
Ensuring alignment between client vision and technical execution is essential to project success.

**Approach to Software Design**
My approach emphasizes research and careful study. While reading documentation and analyzing different strategies can feel time-consuming,
it ultimately reduces errors and avoids costly rework. I also prefer to break work into smaller, manageable sections, using principles similar to Agile methodologies. 
By providing detailed documentation at each step, I set a strong foundation that makes later phases—such as development and testing—more efficient and predictable.
